My name is Rui Xia. I am a PhD candidate in the department of computer science, Nanjing Univerisity. I am supervised by Professor Guihai Chen. I am interested in optimization problems in SDN and NFV systems.

Now, I am focused on network measurement with probabilistic data structures, like bloom filter, sketch.
